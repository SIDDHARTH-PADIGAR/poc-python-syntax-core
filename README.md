# Python Syntax & Core Concepts — Real-World PoCs

This repository contains focused, production-inspired Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) for mastering core Python syntax and constructs. Each file is modular and demonstrates practical usage in scenarios you’ll encounter as a backend, platform, or AI/ML engineer.

## Focus Area 1: Syntax, Types, Control Structures, and Functions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_variables_and_types.py` | Variables, type hints, type aliasing, immutability traps, and structured collections (lists, sets, tuples, dicts). |
| `02_control_structures.py` | Permission systems, endpoint routing, and conditional evaluations using `if`, `match`, loops, and `for/else`. |
| `03_functions_and_args.py` | Real function patterns using default args, `*args`, `**kwargs`, and dispatcher logic. |
| `04_comprehensions.py` | List, dict, set comprehensions for filtering and transforming structured data like API responses. |
| `05_map_filter_lambda.py` | Data pipelines using `map`, `filter`, `lambda`, and functional validation with `any`/`all`. |
| `06_unpacking_enum_zip.py` | Clean iteration strategies using tuple unpacking, `zip`, `enumerate`, and data flattening. |

## Goals

Build muscle memory for Python’s core mechanics  
Apply syntax to real scenarios: logs, validations, reporting, permissions  
Write clean, type-safe, reusable building blocks  
Prepare for larger projects involving APIs, data pipelines, and ML logic
